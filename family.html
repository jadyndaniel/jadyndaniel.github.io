		<p style="color:black;"> I consider my parents and brother to be my best friends. I come from a very tight knit family of people who spend time together whenever we can. My mother, Lisa, is a real estate broker. My father, Jonathan, works in real estate finance. Lastly, my brother, Gavin, is a sophomore in high school. We all love to make recipies and love to eat pizza from our favorite pizza place The s<a href="https://www.johnthebakerrestaurant.com/"> <b>"John The Baker Website"</b> </a> has a combination of all our favorite meals that we love to order every sunday night. Our typical order usually consists of a large cheese pizza, a chicken parmesean for each of us, penne and marinara sauce, a house salad, and garlic bread. We love John The Baker and usually switch up our order every once in a while, however, we typically stick to this order because we love all of those items. We also love to spend our afternoons on weekends in Greenwich, CT, more specifically, Greenwich Avenue. We love to walk around, shop, and of course, try all of the good and delicious resturaunts there. One of my favorite resturaunts that we go to is called Harvest, and my mom and I both love the brusell sprout salad there. Harvest also has delicious burgers, chicken and fish dishes and many different options for anyone. My family and I are very close and I love spending time with them. </a> </p>
