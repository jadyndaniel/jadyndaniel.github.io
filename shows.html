		<p style="color:black;"> Growing up, I have come to love many TV shows. I don't think I will ever be able to rank them in order, however, there are ten shows I can list that will always be favorites. How I Met Your Mother, Gossip Girl, One Tree Hill, The Vampire Diaries, New Girl, Modern Family, The Office, Tell Me Lies, Grey's Anatomy and Curb Your Enthusiasm. These are my top ten FAVORITE shows and I highly reccomend them to everyone! </p>
